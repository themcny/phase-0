		<p>The border refers to the space between the padding and the margin. The border can be however thick you want it (from 0 pixels to 100+ pixels). As a developer, you can choose the color, gradient, and thickness of the border.</p>

<!--Release 7: Reflection

	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	
	Section is useful to break up bigger paragraphs that each need their own subtitles. I also like using the <nav> tag because it's a great way to organize all the links I want on my page. <p> is probably the most used tag since it breaks up large amounts of text and helps make it easier to read. Also using the <header> and <footer> tags are great for styling the header and footer differently than the text in the main content of the page.

	How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	<header> then <body> then <footer> is the order. The <header> gets put at the top of the page and the <footer> gets put after the body. If an <aside> tag was used it would be put to the side of the main text (the developer can choose which side).

	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	I like that snippets can be created. It's a handy tool to quickly put down a framework for an HTML page. I think it'll come in handy in the future too when we start programming in more languages (e.g. Ruby, Javascript, etc.). I like using the [ctrl + d] shortcut to select an entire word. I also use [ctrl + /] to effectily comment easily. Lastly [Alt +] is great for closing the current html tag.-->
