# Reflection

# Release 1
#
# What are these methods doing?
#
# It allows a user to input a name, occupation, and age in order to create a profile.
# 'change_my_age' takes an integer 'new_age' and assigns that trait to the 'Profile' class
# 'change_my_name' takes a string 'new_name' and assigns that trait to the 'Profile' class
# 'change_my_occupation' takes a string 'new_occupation' and assigns that trait to the 'Profile' class
# 'what_is_name' just returns the name string
# 'what_is_age' returns the age integer
# 'what_is_occupation' returns the occupation string
#
#
# How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?
