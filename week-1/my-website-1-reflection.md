Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository, log in to GitHub and navigate to the GitHub homepage. On the right hand side of the page there is a green button that says "+ New repository" (it is located above a list of 'Your repositories'). Click on that button. Now you can name your repository however you see fit and choose whether it is a public or private repo. If you're creating a completely new repo, you can also check the box next to the words 'Initialize this repository with a README'. This will automatically create a file in the repo that can be used to tell others who open your repo what is in the repo. Then, you can also choose whatever license you want. 
To clone this repository, you should look for the box under the title 'HTTPS clone URL'. It is on the right hand side of the page under 'Settings'. Copy this address to your clipboard. Now go to gitbash. You can use the command 'git clone repo-url' to clone the repo to your computer. In order to clone the repo to a particular directory or folder you can add the pathname to the end of the command (e.g. 'git clone repo-url /path/to/repo/folder/'). 

Describe what open source means.

If software is open source it means that anyone can see how the program was made and anyone can customize it to fit their own needs. 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source can facillitate software improvements. It allows many developers to work on improving a piece of software created by different developer. It doesn't make me feel nervous or protective. By opening up software to the entire community, it opens up the software world to innovation. Given the ability for anyone and everyone to modify open source software, if every developer modifies the software without malintent, it would be pretty close to a utopia. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Using licenses is important because they allow software to be used, modified, and shared for a previously agreed upon fee (sometimes free as is the case with open source licenses). 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I can now create and clone a repo without any outside help or instruction. This challenge also helped solidify my ability to commit changes and make pull requests. There weren't any particular "aha" moments but when I was able to create the HTML page without any additional instruction from previous canvas pages it felt good to be able to create an entire page from beginning to end without too much extra help. It still takes some practice and studying to get a hang of the syntax sometimes. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Using the GitHub's own help pages, helped me better understand the process of creating, cloning, and forking repos. Reading another set of instructions helped give me a more complete view of exactly what I was doing on the internet and the local computer files when I was creating, cloning, and forking repos.
