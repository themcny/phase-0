What are the best practices for commit messages?

Commit messages should begin with a short summary - generally 50 characters or less. It should be like the subject line of an email. This subject line should be capitalized and it shouldn't end with a period. Verb tense should be imperative. The body of the commit message is used to explain what and why. The body should also wrap at 72 characters.

HEAD^ is the last commit. So if you wanted to reset what was just committed you would use 'git reset --soft HEAD^'.
