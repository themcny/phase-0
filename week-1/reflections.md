# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Time boxing is a method of trying to help productivity that involves setting a period of time (as short as a few minutes and as long as days) during which a person (or team) will work towards a previously set goal. At the end of the time box, the person (or team) reflects on how much they have accomplished towards the goal. I can use it in phase 0 when completing my own assignments (perhaps by setting myself 25 minute time boxes as per the Pomodoro Technique) or by establishing time boxes and goals for paired programming work with my partner. 

Currently I manage my time with a set schedule where I set aside chunks of time each day to try and do productive work. It isn't currently working because generally, I set aside too much time (leading me to lose motivation and procrastinate because I think I have more time). Additionally, I have found that I schedule productive work times when it is harder for me to get into a 'Flow' (like in the middle of the day). 

I was particularly interested in the use of meditation, both the focusing meditation that can help lessen anxiety and stress as well as the meditation employed as part of the 'Mindful Productivity Ninja' mindset. Though I have never tried meditating, I think that it would help me better focus my energy and silence the risk averse part of my brain. 

Many of the time management and productivity ideas referenced starting small (e.g. Growth Mindset, Counter-intuitive Productivity). In the past, I have been discouraged and found it hard to reach my goals because a task or a goal I set for myself was too large. Breaking it down into smaller, more manageable goals/tasks would definitely help me to be more productive.

I especially liked the Counter-intuitive Productivity ideas regarding not trying to become a productivity robot. That is a pitfall that I've fallen into and it is demoralizing when I am unable to be super productive (like I expect myself to be). The most important things for me to focus on in Phase 0 for time management will be starting small and employing the Pomodoro technique. Being productive for just 25 minutes will help motivate me to actually reach small goals in each time box while allowing me breaks to reflect and do something else. Additionally, I will schedule my 'productive times' for the time of day when I can more easily get into a 'Flow' (early morning or late at night).

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a way to interact with the computer without the fancy fully pre-constructed, user-friendly interface. It allows the user to more fully tap into the full power of the computer. A 'bash' is Unix shell and command language. It processes commands entered by a user.

The most challenging thing was getting a hang of the language and learning patience for when the computer was processing a particularly large amount of data. I have not used a shell for much before so it took some time to memorize the language.

I was able to successfully use all of the commands. Some commands took more tries to understand than others. 

I think being able to master how to navigate the directory is one of the most important commands so making a directory (-mkdir), changing a directory (-cd), list directory (-ls). Moving a file around (-mv) is also important. It allows us to control the files we create. 

-pwd = print working directory

-ls = list directory

-mv = move a file

-cd = changing a directory

-../ = going up a level

-touch = create or update a file

-mkdir = make a directory

-less = show the content of the file one screen at a time

-rmdir = remove a directory

-rm = remove a file

-help = gives help on a bash 

# 1.4 Forking and Clonging Reflection

To create a new repo, log in to your github account and navigate to the github.com homepage while logged in. About halfway down the page, on the right side, there will be a green button saying "+ New repository". Click on this green button. Now you can name your repo, set it private (or keep it private) and add a license (like the MIT License).

 

To fork a repo, navigate to the repo you want to fork (e.g. https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook (Links to an external site.)). Once there, at the upper right hand side of the page (under your profile picture) there should be a grey button that says "fork". Click on that button and it will bring up a pop up that asks where the copy of the repo should be sent. Click on your own profile picture to copy it to your GitHub account. 

 

To clone a repo, navigate to the repo you want to clone (e.g. github.com/[your username]/[repo you want to clone] because you want your forked version of it, not someone else's version of it). At the righthand side of the page, there will be a series of buttons stacked vertically (beginning with "<> Code", followed by "Pull requests" and so on). Below "Settings", there will be text that either says "HTTPS clone URL" or "SSH clone URL". Copy that address to the clipboard.

Then, open your terminal and navigate to the proper directory (i.e. a new folder created for the repo or the desktop). If you are using HTTPS, then use the HTTPS url that you copied and paste it after the command git clone. You will then be asked for your GitHub username and password. Type those in and press enter. Then, after the computer is done executing your command, type in ls to check and make sure that your folder has made it to the intended directory.

 

Forking a repo is a quick way to copy an already existing repo. So if you're working on a project, for which a repo already exists, it would make more sense to copy the existing repo than to create a completely new one from scratch. On the other hand, if you're starting a project from scratch it is probably a good idea to create your own repo to work on it. The fork of a repo allows you to change the repo without affecting the original work.

 

I struggled in learning how to navigate around GitHub. It took me a while to figure out how to go to other user's pages and fork the repos on their pages. Originally, I was trying to fork my own repos which did not work. I've also learned how to better visualize the directory system. At first it was tricky for me to figure out how to get to certain folders and figure out the folder paths, but after some practice creating and moving around directories, I was able to get the hang of it.
