# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Time boxing is a method of trying to help productivity that involves setting a period of time (as short as a few minutes and as long as days) during which a person (or team) will work towards a previously set goal. At the end of the time box, the person (or team) reflects on how much they have accomplished towards the goal. I can use it in phase 0 when completing my own assignments (perhaps by setting myself 25 minute time boxes as per the Pomodoro Technique) or by establishing time boxes and goals for paired programming work with my partner. 

Currently I manage my time with a set schedule where I set aside chunks of time each day to try and do productive work. It isn't currently working because generally, I set aside too much time (leading me to lose motivation and procrastinate because I think I have more time). Additionally, I have found that I schedule productive work times when it is harder for me to get into a 'Flow' (like in the middle of the day). 

I was particularly interested in the use of meditation, both the focusing meditation that can help lessen anxiety and stress as well as the meditation employed as part of the 'Mindful Productivity Ninja' mindset. Though I have never tried meditating, I think that it would help me better focus my energy and silence the risk averse part of my brain. 

Many of the time management and productivity ideas referenced starting small (e.g. Growth Mindset, Counter-intuitive Productivity). In the past, I have been discouraged and found it hard to reach my goals because a task or a goal I set for myself was too large. Breaking it down into smaller, more manageable goals/tasks would definitely help me to be more productive.

I especially liked the Counter-intuitive Productivity ideas regarding not trying to become a productivity robot. That is a pitfall that I've fallen into and it is demoralizing when I am unable to be super productive (like I expect myself to be). The most important things for me to focus on in Phase 0 for time management will be starting small and employing the Pomodoro technique. Being productive for just 25 minutes will help motivate me to actually reach small goals in each time box while allowing me breaks to reflect and do something else. Additionally, I will schedule my 'productive times' for the time of day when I can more easily get into a 'Flow' (early morning or late at night).

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a way to interact with the computer without the fancy fully pre-constructed, user-friendly interface. It allows the user to more fully tap into the full power of the computer. A 'bash' is Unix shell and command language. It processes commands entered by a user.

The most challenging thing was getting a hang of the language and learning patience for when the computer was processing a particularly large amount of data. I have not used a shell for much before so it took some time to memorize the language.

I was able to successfully use all of the commands. Some commands took more tries to understand than others. 

I think being able to master how to navigate the directory is one of the most important commands so making a directory (-mkdir), changing a directory (-cd), list directory (-ls). Moving a file around (-mv) is also important. It allows us to control the files we create. 

-pwd = print working directory

-ls = list directory

-mv = move a file

-cd = changing a directory

-../ = going up a level

-touch = create or update a file

-mkdir = make a directory

-less = show the content of the file one screen at a time

-rmdir = remove a directory

-rm = remove a file

-help = gives help on a bash
