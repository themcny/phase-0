**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is one of many steps in the design process. It makes it easier for the developer to plan the layout of the website (or app) the developer is working on. It is an easy way to arrange places for pieces of information that the developer wants to include in the website.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

Wireframing allows the developer to organize the layout of the site without getting bogged down in the actual information that will be displayed on the site. It simplfies the process of working on the layout of a site. There are also no colors or shading to distract from the designing process.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

It was pretty fun to try different layouts and add different buttons. There were so many ways and options for website layout. It was fun for the first half hour, then it got frustrating because it never seemed 100% perfect. 

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I revised my wireframe once, but I stopped myself from continuing to revise because I realized that I could spend a long time trying to adjust everything pixel by pixel to make it 'perfect'.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I used google to find the right kind of wireframing software for me. (I wound up using Mockingbird because it was easy to use thanks to the drag and drop feature and it allowed me to search for specific features.) All other questions I had about how wireframes should look were answered by looking through the "I <3 wireframes" site. I also read through the site [How to Make Useful Website Wireframes](https://http://blog.market8.net/b2b-web-design-and-inbound-marketing-blog/how-to-make-useful-website-wireframes-tutorial "How to Make Useful Website Wireframes [Tutorial]") and the site [Ultimate Guide to Website Wireframing](https://http://sixrevisions.com/user-interface/website-wireframing/ "Ultimate Guide to Website Wireframing"). It gave me other people's perspectives on why Wireframing is useful. 


**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I really liked the playing around with the different features and functions I could potentially add onto the website. While fun at first, it eventually became tedious because there is no end. The options for what to add to my website were limitless and I could have added so much functionality and so many cool features in many different layouts. It's easy to get caught up in the tedium of trying a bunch of different features and different arrangements.
