4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

The primary goal is to put information about myself out to the public. It is a way that potential employers can see my skills in action as well as find out more about projects that I've worked on. Additionally, there will be information on how to contact me. My site will primarily feature my professinal portfolio with some blogging about the projects that I've worked on. 

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience will be future employers and other developers. Their interests are probably the projects I have worked on as well as ways to contact me. To that end, my site will be focused on displaying my professional resume (with links to my GitHub so that my projects will be easily viewable) and giving people avenues to contact me. 

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary action will be to see my portfolio and then contact me for potential employers. For developers that are my peers, the primary action will be to read through my blog posts and perhaps commiserate about shared challenges or frustrations. 

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

In order to design and create a user experience that is appropriate for the site, the designer has to know what the function and goal of the site is, who the target audience for the site is, and what kind of information is going to be presented on the site (for the target audience to find).

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?** 

User experience design is focused on how people using the website (or app) feel about the website. It's about how easy the website is to navigate, how easy it is to find the pertinent information, and how pleasing or satisfying the website is. It is valuable because there is a plethora of websites with similar information. Making your website easy to use and navigate, means that more people will choose to go to your website over others. 

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

It was a bit tedious navigating through directories again, but I realize that it is good practice for the future. I think using the command prompt is only tedious now because I'm not quite as fast as I wish I was sometimes, although doing all the challenges has provided me with many great opporunities to practice and I can tell that I'm improving.
