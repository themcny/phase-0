**What does `puts` do?**

Puts prints the output (of your code) to the console with a new line. It also returns nil.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

Integers are numbers without decimal points. (e.g. 5, -10, 1234567890)

Floats (a.k.a. floating-point numbers) are numbers with decimal points. (e.g. 1.2 3.14159265358, .3, 0.0)

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**



**Hours in a Year**
```ruby
puts "On a regular year: #{365*24} hours."
puts "On a leap year #{366*24} hours."
```

**Minutes in a Decade**
```ruby
puts "If there are only two leap years in that decade: #{((10*365)+2))*24*60} minutes."
puts "If there are three leap years in that decade:#{(10*365+3)*24*60} minutes."
```
