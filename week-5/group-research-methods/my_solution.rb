# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# 
# .select - the select method finds array elements or hash key/value pairs that match the criterion on the right 
# .to_s - converts any object to a string
# .include? - figures out of a string includes a specified sub-string
# .keys - returns an array of just the keys in a hash



# Release 2: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
# 
#.select - is used in a similar way as .each. The difference is that where the .each method
# => does something to every single element of an array, the .select method just finds the
# => key/value pairs of a hash or elements of an array that fall into the criterion specified on
# => the far right in the curly bars. 
#
#.to_s is a fairly easy method to implement. It's used turn any object into a string. 2.to_s will
# => return the string "2".
#
#.include?() - put whatever integer, float, or sub-string, you're looking for within those parenthesis
# => in front of the period put whatever collection of data you're looking through
# => so it reads data_collection.include?("sub-string") where data_collection is some collection of data
# => (or just a single piece of data).
#
#.keys - when the method is placed after a hash, returns an array made up of only the keys of that hash


# The only trick I have for going through the Ruby Docs is liberal use of ctrl + f to find
# key words that I thought would be related to methods I wanted to use.
